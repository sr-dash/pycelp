# Code Examples Recreating Schad & Dima 2020 Figures

This directory contains scripts that can be used to recreate the figures presented in Schad & Dima (2020), which used an earlier version of the code.  These scripts can also give one assurance that the code is working properly as it benchmarks itself against Chianti results. 

Note that Schad & Dima (2020) used Chianti v9.  The current version of pyCELP uses Chianti v10.  The most significant change between v9 and v10 was that the Si IX model went from 46 levels to 590 levels.  The example notebooks in this directory have been updated to use the v10 models.
